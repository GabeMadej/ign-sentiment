# Game Article Sentiment Analysis API

## Project Overview
This Flask-based web application was created to showcase advanced data analytics skills using python through the development of an API that performs sentiment analysis on video game articles.

At its core, the application automates the process of extracting content from IGN News, targeting articles related to a predefined list of popular video games. It then employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically using nltk's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, to analyze the sentiment conveyed in these articles. This analysis provides valuable insights into the public perception and reception of these games as reflected in the media.

Key highlights of the project include:

- **Automated Data Collection:** Leveraging Selenium and BeautifulSoup for robust web scraping, enabling the programmatic collection of relevant data.
- **NLP and Sentiment Analysis:** Utilization of NLP techniques to understand and quantify the sentiment expressed in the articles. This involves complex text processing and sentiment scoring, showcasing the ability to derive meaningful insights from textual data.
- **Data Aggregation and Analysis:** The application doesn't just collect data; it processes and aggregates it to calculate the average word count and overall sentiment score for each game. This demonstrates skills in data manipulation and statistical analysis.
- **API Development:** Building a Flask-based API to serve the analyzed data, which can be easily accessed and utilized by other applications or services.

The project is a testament to the ability to seamlessly integrate different aspects of data analytics, web development, and software engineering to create a functional and insightful application.

## Key Features
- **Web Scraping**: Automated scraping of game-related articles from IGN News using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizes nltk's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer for sentiment analysis of article content.
- **API Endpoints**: Flask-based API to retrieve analysis results.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Selenium
- BeautifulSoup
- nltk

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later.
- Flask, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, nltk, and other required libraries.

### Installation and Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/GabeMadej/ign-sentiment.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   This will start the Flask server and make the API accessible.

### Using the API
- To analyze a specific game and get its sentiment analysis, access the endpoint:
  ```
  http://localhost:8080/analyze/<game_name>
  ```
  Replace `<game_name>` with the name of the game you want to analyze. 

### Customization
- Modify the `game_names` list in the Python script to analyze different games.
- You can also change the news source URL (`index_url`) and other parameters as per your requirements.
